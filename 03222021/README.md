# Notes

## Tracing

- Run the code

```
$ go run trace.go
```

After running the code `trace.go`, it will output a file named `trace.out`. In order to see the meaning of the file and understand the tracing, type:

```
$ go tool trace trace.out
```

And your browser will open the tracing info, or you can see the port in the console output. Click on first option and go on. <br />
